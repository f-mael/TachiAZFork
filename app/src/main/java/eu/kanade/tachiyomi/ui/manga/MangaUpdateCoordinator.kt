/**
 * Shares a single [Source.getMangaUpdate] call between the info and chapters tabs of a
 * [MangaController], and saves everything it returns.
 *
 * Both tabs are created at once by the pager and each used to fetch on its own — details in one,
 * chapters in the other — which meant two concurrent calls for the same manga. Some extension
 * bases guard against that and throw on the second one. Here the two tabs share one call that
 * fetches both halves, and both halves are persisted here rather than in each tab, so nothing the
 * source returned is dropped just because the tab that would have saved it never fetched.
 *
 * The request runs in this coordinator's own scope, so a tab that goes away mid-flight (the user
 * leaves the screen, the view is recreated) cancels only its own wait, not the shared fetch. A
 * successful result is kept for the lifetime of the controller so a later non-forced fetch reuses
 * it; a failed one is dropped so the next fetch retries.
